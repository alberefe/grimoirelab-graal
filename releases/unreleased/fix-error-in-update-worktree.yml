title: Fix error in update worktree
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: #112
notes: >
   Graal wasn't working with the latest version of Git
   2.35.1 because it protects braches checked out in all
   worktrees. This change renames the branch created when
   creating a worktree to fix the issue.
